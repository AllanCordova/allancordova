# 🧑‍💻 Personal Portfolio - Allan

Welcome to my personal portfolio website, built with **Angular**.  
Here I showcase my projects, technologies I work with, and a bit about who I am as a developer.

## 🚀 About the Project

This project was created to serve as my online presence, a place where I can:

- Present myself professionally
- Share my skills and technologies I use
- Display my portfolio projects
- Provide a way to contact me

## 🌑 Theme

The portfolio uses a **dark theme** to ensure modern aesthetics and better visual comfort.  
The design is fully responsive and structured using a clean and modular layout.
